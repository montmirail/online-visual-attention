 * This is the landing page for the experiment. Here the subject logs in.
 * Once the system verifies the username, the page reloads to display links to
 * both the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task and the Useful Field of View (UFOV) task,
 * as well as an additional link to a pre-determined task chosen for the subject -- this
 * is for ensuring a counterbalanced order, as the order of the tasks (MOT then UFOV or
 * UFOV then MOT) is determined based on if the subject is an even or odd numbered subject.
 * NOTE: This does NOT have anything to do with their username; instead, it is determined by
 * when they were added to the database.
